I am a Controls, Robotics, & Autonomy major junior at Virginia Tech with a hands-on interest in embedded systems, robotics, and software to hardware integration. I am particularly drawn to work that involves mainly hardware, where design, programming, and system design come together to create effective solutions.

Through rigorous coursework, independent projects, and hands on experience, I have developed a foundation in embedded programming, software development, and digital and analog systems. I am especially motivated by learning through building. My projects range from embedded applications and interactive games on microcontroller platforms to hardware-controlled systems that integrate sensing, actuation, and real time user input. Alongside my academic work, my professional experience in electrical and systems troubleshooting has strengthened my ability to think critically and adapt quickly.

I am currently seeking research or internship opportunities where i can meaningfully contribute to ongoing technical work while continuing to grow as an engineer. I am particularly interested in environments valuing curiosity and critical thinking, and I hope to pursue work that advances my technical depth and my ability to solve impactful engineering problems.
